/**
 * Map-Browser Pure Logic — tile index, name filter, zoom→resolution.
 *
 * The heart of the map-centric recording browser, kept free of Leaflet/DOM so
 * it is fully unit-testable:
 *   - `leafletZoomToH3Res` picks the H3 clustering resolution for a map zoom.
 *   - `buildTileIndex` groups recordings into the H3 tiles their coverage
 *     clusters to at that resolution, so a tile click can list "which tours
 *     cross this tile?".
 *   - `matchesNameFilter` / `filterRecordingsByName` implement the D5 name
 *     search (case-insensitive substring over the zip filename).
 *
 * @see ./recording-index.ts for the per-recording coverage this consumes
 * @see GpsPlusSlamJs_Docs/docs/2026-06-14-map-centric-recording-browser-and-h3-index-user-feedback.md (D3/D5)
